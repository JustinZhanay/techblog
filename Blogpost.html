	<p>	The video "Humans Need not Apply" speaks about the changes and improvements of technology. Before robots, humans were very active and did hard labor to survive. As technology improved we as a society have slowly been getting lazier and now rely on it too much. The video explains that overtime our jobs and everything we do will be replaced by robots. They will be able to do things we couldn't do and do our work better. This can affect the way we </p>
	<p>	I agree with the video's argument and it's prediction for the future. As of right now technology is so good that we let it do the hard labor for us. During the Industrial Revolution, humans used to work in factories all day crafting products to sell. Unfortunately, technology has been so good that they do our jobs better. This will lead to many people losing jobs and being unemployed. This will be a huge issue in the future as many people won't be able to support themselves and their families. The government will have to either limit the amount of robots used in companies or start paying workers for doing nothing.</p>

		<h3>I agree!</h3>

		<p>I agree with what you said because robots are better better at doing our jobs and we might lose our jobs because of it. Also I like the image you chose for the blog.</p>

	<h2>Blown to Bits</h2>

	<h4>Footprints and Fingerprints</h4>
	<p>This section of the book reviews that when we use any piece of technology such as our phones or use the internet, we leave traces of ourselves or "footprints" behind. Just as we can see our footprints in mud we leave evidence behind when we send emails. In the digital world, it's called electronic footprints and electronic fingerprints. Most of us don't realize that we leave fingerprints behind and most of us don't really care so we tend to not worry. However, by leaving just a small smudge on the digital landscape it can help strangers take our identities or steal our money. It's important that we be careful where we leave electronic footprints and fingerprints.</p>
	<h4>Knowing Where You Are</h4>
	<p>If someone is ever lost most people either ask for directions or use a Global Position System (GPS). Because technology had improved so much, people use the GPS more often than ever. The GPS is great for traveling and arriving to places on a specific time. It calculates it's location from the satallites' location and it sends signals to track your car. If renting a car, people can track down your location whether you want it or not. Having a GPS on your phone can also help you locate your friends. All of this are benefits, but there are also drawbacks to GPS's. People are able to stalk people are trace their location withour them knowing. This can be dangerous because it could to the person being harmed or killed. The GPS can be use for good intentions and at the same time for wrong ones.</p>
	<h4>Tracing Paper</h4>
	<p>Before the internet, people wrote notes on paper with a pencil. If they wanted to be anonymous they wouldn't write their name on it, but the handwriting could be recognizable and maybe their fingerprints could be left on the paper. Today people on the internet still leave evidence of themselves such as sending an email or downloading a web page. When people want to be anonymous when typing they could laserprint the letter and wear gloves, but it's not suffice to disguise them. There are techniques that could match the laser-printed output to a particular printer. </p>
	<h4>Personal Reflection</h4>
	<p>All three sections of "Blown To Bits" has convinced me that although the internet has improved so much for the better, there are still drawbacks to using technology. People should be cautious to not leave electronic footprints and electronic fingerprints behind because it could lead to identity theft. The GPS can be used by messed up people who want to stalk other or try to take advantage of their privacy. When using the internet, we should be careful what we do and say because it could always be traced back to you no matter how anonymous you think you are.</p>

	<h2>Interview</h2>
	<h3>I took the time to interview my mom Narcisa Zhanay about technology in the past. I tried my best.</h3>
	<img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201601/interview-647-x--404_011616120909.jpg">

	<h4>Justin: What kind of technology did you have growing up?
	<h4>Narcisa: I had a Radio with batteries  and a small TV with a black and white image.</h4></h4>
	<h4>Justin: How different are TV's now from when you had a TV as a kid?</h4>
	<h4>Narcisa: Growing up, my television had no color and everything had to be done manual such as getting up to change the volume and hitting the tv to get signal. Now things are much easier.</h4>
	<h4>Justin: When did you get your first phone? What phone was it and how does it compare to your phone right now?</h4>
	<h4>Narcisa: My first phone wasn't a phone but a telephone. The telephone used to be shared by my entire town. I've had other phones as a got older such as a sidekick and later a blackberry. Today I have an Iphone 7 and everyone has their own phone and in their household.</h4>
	<h4>Justin: Have phones improved society or hurt society?</h4>
	<h4>Narcisa: It has helped society greatly. People now have access to news and get updated in other countries in just seconds. In the past it took months to get news.</h4>
